# Hey, I'm Lucy!

My name is Lucy and I'm a current PhD researcher at the University of Glasgow. My research areas include sociophonetics, speaker perception, cognition, accent imitation/disguise, and media studies. In essence, I love all things 'speechy'! I am interested in the link between social identity and language. Additionally, I am very interested in accent use in the media and accent bias.

I am currently looking at social behaviours such as attitudes, and our perceptions of those around us. I'll be looking at media effects on human cognition and behaviour, so that means I get to be let free on sparkly toys such as eye-tracking software. For my research, I use Python, R and PRAAT scripting for data analysis. 

As well as a researcher, I teach English Language and Linguistics at the University of Glasgow. As a graduate teaching assistant, I cover topics such as phonetics, sociolinguistics, Scots, historical linguistics, experimental design and statistics. I am also the social media co-ordinator for GULP (Glasgow University Laboratory of Phonetics).


Take a look around to see what I've been up to. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.

- **4 April 2024**: I spent some time at the Leibniz-Centre of General Linguistics [(ZAS)](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/about-us/institute){target='_blank'} institute in Berlin, Germany. I absolutely loved getting to see their phenomenal facilities and hear all about their [exciting work](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/research/research-areas){target='_blank'}. A huge thank you to [Sarah Wesolek](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/people/details/wesolek-sarah/sarah-wesolek){target='_blank'} and [Marzena Å»ygis](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/people/details/zygis-marzena/marzena-zygis){target='_blank'} for this [wunderbar opportunity!](https://twitter.com/lucejackson/status/1778757070717624754){target='_blank'}

- **25-27 March 2024**: I presented my research at the *Colloquium of the British Association of Academic Phoneticians* [(BAAP)](https://sites.google.com/view/baap-2024/en){target='_blank'} in Cardiff, Wales. Great to get feedback on my research and future experiments, catching up with friends and one too many Welsh cakes.

- **19 January 2024**: We launched the *'PhDnetics network'*, with our first meeting at Queen Margaret University. A student-led network for PhD researchers and Postdocs in phonetics, across Scotland. Our vision is to have a community that shares expertise, knowledge and support. The day was a blast!

- **23-25 August 2023**: The Scottish sun was shining four our Residential trip to Millport, hosted by [SGSAH](https://www.sgsah.ac.uk/prospective/){target='_blank'}. A brilliant couple of days shared with fellow doctoral researchers across Scotland, with a delicious balance of researcher development workshops and... [cheese!](https://twitter.com/lucejackson/status/1695101875886940176){target='_blank'}

- **7-11 August 2023**: I was invited to give a talk at the [International Congress of Phonetic Sciences 2023](https://www.icphs2023.org/){target='_blank'} in Prague. This was based on my recent study 'Game of Phones: A sociophonetic analysis of stylised media performance of Yorkshire English'. I had a blast seeing old friends and making new. You might be able to spot me on Geoff's fantastic vlog: {{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDpVPj49R8w

- **31 March 2023**: I was delighted to win the People's Choice Award at the [University of Glasgow three-minute thesis (3MT) competition](https://uofgpgrblog.com/pgrblog/2023/5/19/3-minute-thesis-2023-everything-you-need-to-know?rq=3mt){target='_blank'}. I gave my 'speedy' talk on 'Accents in the spotlight: Uncovering our unconscious biases'.

- **22 March 2023**: It was a great pleasure to be invited to talk at [Hutchesons' Grammar School](https://www.hutchesons.org/){target='_blank'}. Here I spoke about accent bias: its effects in society and how we can tackle this discrimination. Thank you for all the wonderful students and staff who welcomed me!
