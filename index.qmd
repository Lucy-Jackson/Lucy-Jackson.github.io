# Hey, I'm Lucy!

My name is Lucy and I'm a current PhD researcher at the University of Glasgow.  I am interested in the link between social identity and language. My areas of expertise are sociophonetics, social cognition and behaviour analysis, and processes involved in the social categorisation of speech. I am specifically interested in accent use in the media and accent bias. 

As part of my research, I am exploring the use of time-series analyses such as eye tracking as an implicit measure of implicit cognition and biases. I am also interested in the use of large-scale corpora and modelling for social and linguistic inquiry.


As well as a researcher, I teach English Language and Linguistics at the University of Glasgow. As a graduate teaching assistant, I cover topics such as phonetics, sociolinguistics, Scots, historical linguistics, experimental design and statistics. I am also the social media co-ordinator for GULP (Glasgow University Laboratory of Phonetics).


Take a look around to see what I've been up to!

- **2nd September 2025**: I presented my research at the biennial conference, [UKLVC](https://wp.lancs.ac.uk/uklvc15/) that looks at language variation and change. Here, I presented my study 'The CAT's out the bag' - which looked at CAT vowel quality sound change over the last 60 years, and demonstrated the use of Generalised Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) in plotting non-linear relationships. You can find more info on this in my research tab or better yet, get in touch!

- **29th November 2024**: I presented my research 'Mediatisation of the Marginalised' at the Forum for Research on the Languages of Scotland and Ulster (FRLSU 2024, Belfast). I spoke alongside fellow researchers and langauge activists, on the consideration of the broadcast media and its impact on linguistic prejudices. I would like to express deep gratitude to the FRLSU body for awarding me with the student travel bursary award, allowing me to attend in person.
